cheatsheets/

	Various command line incantations and other notes which I use so little
I tend to forget them.

docs/
	Various short (or not so short) documents, for users, developers and
myself.  A large part of these are in Dutch.

scripts/

	Contains several small, often pretty stupid one-off scripts for various
sysadmin tasks.  Most of these are really simple, but would cause me just
enough pain if I needed to rewrite them from scratch to motivate me to archive
them here.

	You're free to use them as well, but none of the scripts are guaranteed
to work in your setup, and some might even fail spectacularly, so:

	BEWARE: USING THESE SCRIPTS MAY DESTROY YOUR DATA

	I'm also not going to support these scripts, but patches are welcome.
(No guarantees I'll apply them though - so feel free to distribute your own
versions!)
