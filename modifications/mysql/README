This init script is a modified version of the Debian init script for MySQL.  It
adds a check for open temporary tables when replication is enabled, and delays
shutting down the MySQL server until they're all closed.

http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/replication-features-temptables.html
explains why this is needed.
